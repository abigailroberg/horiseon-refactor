# Refactored Code - Horiseon Website

## Description
Updated existing HTML & CSS for Horiseon to
  -follow accessibility standards to optimize the website for search engines
  -have simpler CSS without sacrificing style
  -ensure all links work properly
 
 This was done through the addition of semantic HTML elements, and the creation of classes to condense CSS where the style of various elements needed to be the same.
